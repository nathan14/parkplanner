  Magic Kingdom Park is the main park out of 4 parks in Walt Disney World Orlando, Florida. <br />
  The park is divided into a few "lands" with different themes. <br />
  Those who visited Disneyland Paris, might find many areas familiar. <br />

<p>
  Each land will provide different expirence and going through the park and seeing all land is a must. <br />
  An area where lots of change occured recently, is the New Fantayland where you can meet Bell (Beauty & The Beast), Gaston and many more... <br />
  You will get the opportunity to dine at The Beast's castle and ride the Seven Dwarfs new rollecoaster.
