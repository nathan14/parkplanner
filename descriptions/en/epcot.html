<p>Epcot stands for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow and is one out of 4 main parks in Walt Disney World Orlando.<br />
  The park is divided into 2 main areas - Future World and World Showcase.</p>
<p>Future World is the place where the main rides are, it's best to plan your route from there since the other area usually opens at 11am. <br />
  In Future World you will find some &quot;not to miss&quot; rides such a Soarin where you will sky high over Califronia and Test Track where you get into a car you build yourself while testing it on extreme conditions.
</p>
<p>World Showcase provide the guests with experiences from different countries all over the world - Japan, China, Mexico, France, Canada &amp; more.</p>
