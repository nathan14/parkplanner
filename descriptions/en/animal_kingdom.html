  Disney's Animal Kingdom is one of 4 main theme parks in Walt Disney World Orlando. <br />
  This is a very special theme park since it's both a theme park and a safari. <br />
<p>
  Animal Kingdom's main attraction is the Kilimanjaro Safaris where you will go on a ride with a special guide to tour the jungles while seeing all kinds of animals. <br />
  While not having a special show at night since the parks closes quite early, Animal Kingodm offers lots of great shows during the day such as Lion King and the 4D show - It's tough to be a bug.
