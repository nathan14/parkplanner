<p>Island of Advantures is one of two parks in Universal Stuidos Orlando Resort.<br />
  The park is divided into different section - Marvel's Superheo Land, Wizarding World of Harry Potter and more..<br />
The rides in Island of Advantures considered to be &quot;very extreme&quot; so you won't see too many little children around this park.</p>
<p>For Harry Potter fans, the Wizarding World will defenitly provide a great expirience, starting with a ride inside Hogwarts where you can play Quidditch and even drinking butter beer.<br />
  Another famous ride is The Hulk - a crazy roller coaster with loops which shouldn't be missed!
